<h2>Old Releases</h2>
<p>
The Mercury distribution has been released to the public several times.
The release information pages for these older releases may contain
useful information, including release notes and known problems,
sometimes with work-arounds or patches.   If you are experiencing
problems with these releases, it might be worth installing the <a
href="release.html">current release</a>
</p>

Please note, however, that the source and binaries for these
releases are often no longer available from the FTP site.

<h2 id="11.01">Release 11.01</h2>

Mercury 11.01 was released on April 27, 2011.

<h3>Supported Platforms</h3>
<p>
The latest release is known to work on the following platforms:

</p>

<ul class="nonindentlist">
    <li> x86 and x86-64 machines running Linux 
    <li> x86 and x86-64 machines running Microsoft Windows XP 3, Windows 7,

    <li> Apple Intel machines (both x86 and x86-64) running Mac OS X 10.5 and above
</ul>

<p>

It should be pretty easy to port to any sufficiently Unix-like system.

<h3>What do I need?</h3>

<ul class="nonindentlist">
<li> For Unix systems, you will need the following:
    <ol class="nonindentlist">
    <li> <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GNU C (gcc)</a>
         <br/>
         GCC version 3.4.x or later is required.

	 It has bugs that cause 
	 internal compiler errors when compiling the C code generated by the

<h3>How to get the distribution</h3>
<p>
You can go to our FTP sites or mirrors, or directly
download the source or binary distributions.

</p>
<p>
Note that although the source distribution is much smaller than
the binary distribution, the compilation process will
almost always take more time than is saved by the smaller
download.
</p>

<!--
<h3><a name="source">Source Distribution</a></h3>
<p>
The main "mercury-compiler" source distribution is about 10 Mb.
This includes the compiler, standard library,
debugger, profilers, and other tools.
(Note that this does <em>not</em> include all the sources needed to build
the <a href="<?php echo $root?>/download/gcc-backend.html">

"mercury-gcc" and "gcc" distributions.

<p>

There is also a small "mercury-extras" distribution which contains a number
of useful additional libraries.  This is distributed separately,
mainly for copyright reasons (some of the additional libraries do
not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines).
We strongly recommend that everyone who downloads the "compiler"
distribution should also download the "extras" distribution.

<br>
	To install, open a Cygwin bash shell, and type in the commands
	"tar zxf mercury-0.11.0.i686-pc-cygwin.tar.gz",
	"cd mercury-0.11.0.i686-pc-cygwin",

<?php 
links_to_file("mercury-compiler-0.11.0.i686-pc-mingw.zip",

<br>
	The Mingw version still requires Cygwin,
	but the executables that it generates do not require Cygwin. 
	(That is, it's a cross-compiler from Cygwin to native Windows.)
	To install, open a Cygwin bash shell, and do
	<pre>unzip -d / mercury-compiler-0.11.0.i686-pc-mingw.zip</pre>
	Note that you <strong>must</strong> use the Cygwin unzip program,
	not WinZip.  "WinZip" doesn't handle Cygwin's symbolic links properly.

<h4><a name="source">Source Distribution</a></h4>

The main "mercury-compiler" source distribution is about 10 Mb.
This includes the compiler, standard library,
debugger, profiler, and other tools.
(Note that this does <em>not</em> include all the sources needed to build
the <a href="<?php echo $root?>/download/gcc-backend.html">
native-code back-end</a>; for that you also need the
"mercury-gcc" and "gcc" distributions.
See <a href="<?php echo $root?>/download/gcc-backend.html">here</a>
for details.)

<p>

There is also a small "mercury-extras" distribution which contains a number
of useful additional libraries.  This is distributed separately,
mainly for copyright reasons (some of the additional libraries do
not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines).
We strongly recommend that everyone who downloads the "compiler"
distribution should also download the "extras" distribution.

<p>

Finally there is also a "mercury-tests" distribution which contains our
test suite.  This may be useful if you are modifying the compiler,
or porting it to a new system.

GNU Make versions &gt;= 3.76 were fixed.  A few features were also added.

<h3>Release 0.7.2</h3>

On the 13th October, 1997 we released Mercury 0.7.2. This release fixed

for user-defined equality predicates and generalized trailing.
We also split the distribution into "core" and "extras".

<h3>Release 0.6.2-1</h3>

On the 2nd of June, 1997, Debian GNU/Linux 1.3 was released, including a
slightly modified Mercury 0.6.2 as one of the stable development
packages.  Thanks to Milan Zamazal (pdm@fi.muni.cz) for preparing this
package.  This package can be obtained at any of the Debian mirrors -
see the <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian Web Site</a> for more
information on Debian.  It will also be available on any official Debian
1.3 CDs.  Please note: this Debian version "mercury 0.6.2-1" uses a
different name for the Mercury compiler `mc' due to name clashes with
another package, so the documentation (user's guide in particular)
should read `mercury' instead of `mc'.  This problem will be fixed in
Mercury 0.7.

for both the source and binary distributions).  
The version of Mercury 0.6 with these patches applied to is referred to
as 0.6.1.<p>
