Please treat ROTDs with caution -- although they are often very
useful and reasonably stable, they are not widely tested, and
may have unfinished features and rough edges.  We are still interested
in feedback and bug reports on the ROTDs.  Please file bug reports in our
<a href="http://bugs.mercury.csse.unimelb.edu.au">bug database</a>.

<h3>What do I need?</h3>

<ul class="nonindentlist">
<li> For Unix systems, you will need the following:<p>
    <ol class="indentlist">
    <li> <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GNU C (gcc)</a>
	 <p>
	 We recommend using GCC version 4.2 or later, although most
         versions from 3.4.X onwards should work.
         <p>
         The following versions of GCC will definitely NOT work: 3.0, 3.3.1, 4.0.
	 They have bugs that cause internal compiler errors when compiling the C code generated
         by the Mercury compiler.
         <p>
         Avoid GCC 2.96 (distributed with Red Hat Linux 7.x) and any
         other unofficial releases of GCC.  Also avoid versions of GCC less 
	 than GCC 2.95.X.
         <p>
	 It is also possible to use other C compilers, such as
	 <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>.
	 <!--
         It is also possible to use other C compilers, such as
         <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/">lcc</a>,
         but we don't recommend that.
	 -->
         <p>
    <li> GNU make (version 3.69 or higher).
    </ol>

    <p>

<li> For Windows,<p>
     <ol>
     <li> To compile the source distribution on Windows you 
          will need either <a href=http://www.cygwin.com/>Cygwin</a>,
          which you can download
          <a href=http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe>here</a>,
	  or <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MSYS</a>. 
          Both Cygwin and MSYS include GNU C and GNU Make.<p>
     <li> You can optionally use
          <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/60k1461a.aspx">
          Microsoft Visual C</a> rather than GNU C (though Cygwin
	  or MSYS is still required).<p>
     </ol>

<li> To compile Mercury programs to Java, you will need the
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp#jdk">Java SDK</a>
     version 5.0 or higher.
     <p>

<li> To compile Mercury programs to Erlang, you will need the
     <a href="http://erlang.org/download.html">Erlang OTP</a>.
     <p>

<li> To compile Mercury programs to C#, you will need the
     <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework">Microsoft .NET Framework</a>
     version 2.0 or later, or
     <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> version 2.8 or later.

<!--
<li> The .NET back-end currently does not work. However,
     if you want to take a look at our preliminary support for .NET,
     you also need 
      <ol>
	  <li> the Microsoft .NET SDK version 1, available from
	       <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/">
	       MSDN</a>.
	       If you are an MSDN Universal subscriber you can
	       also order CDs as part of your subscription.
	  <li> A Windows system suitable for development with
	       Microsoft .NET, such as Windows XP.
      </ol>

<h3><a name="source">Source Distribution</a></h3>

The main "mercury-compiler" source distribution includes the compiler, 
standard library, debugger, profilers, and other tools.

<p>

There is also a "mercury-extras" distribution which contains a number
of useful additional libraries.  This is distributed separately,
mainly for copyright reasons (some of the additional libraries do
not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines).

<p>

Finally there is also a "mercury-tests" distribution which contains our
test suite.  This may be useful if you are modifying the compiler,
or porting it to a new system.
