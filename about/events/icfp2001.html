<H1><A NAME="section-1.">Heavy Metal: the Mercury Entry for the ICFP 2001 Programming Contest</A></H1>

<P>
Ralph Becket &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rbeck@microsoft.com">rbeck@microsoft.com</A>&gt;, 30 August 2001 

<P>
This document describes one of the Mercury entries for the ICFP 2001
programming contest.  We have to wait for the results to be announced
on 4 September before we can report them here. 

<H1><A NAME="section-2.">The Team</A></H1>

<UL>
  <LI>UK: Ralph Becket (that's me) wrote the code. 
  <LI>Belgium: Peter Ross at Mission Critical and Tyson Dowd visiting
   from Melbourne University. 
  <LI>Germany: Holger Krug at Rationalizer (Holger offered much useful
   advice by e-mail). 

</UL>
<P>
Before the contest some half dozen people around the world had
expressed an interest in participating in a Mercury team, although
many had to pull out at the last minute because of personal
commitments. 

<H1><A NAME="section-3.">The Problem</A></H1>

<P>
A complete description of the problem can be found at the contest home
page <A HREF="http://cristal.inria.fr/ICFP2001/prog-contest/">http://cristal.inria.fr/ICFP2001/prog-contest/</A> 

<P>
In a nutshell, the problem was to construct a document optimizer for a
fictitious XML-like text markup language dubbed SML/NG (Simple Markup
Language/New Generation). The language comprises several tags, each of
which affects various attributes (bold, emphasis, size, colour etc.)
applying to the text enclosed by the tags. 

<P>
This is an instance of a re-bracketing problem which in itself is far
from trivial. The addition of "real-world" style mark-up semantics
contrives to make matters even more difficult. 

<P>
There are some complicated tags such as PL which affects several
attributes, the EM tag that toggles the emphasis state, and the U tag
that increases the level of underlining. 

<P>
Some attributes also interact with one another: the strong emphasis
attribute hides the ordinary emphasis attribute and only three levels
of underlining are significant. 

<P>
There are complicated rules for deciding whether strings of whitespace
should be rendered as just a single space or not. 

<P>
Finally, while documents may assume an evaluation context equivalent
to being placed inside a &lt;PL&gt;...&lt;/PL&gt; block, they cannot assume any
particular root context colour or size attributes. 

<P>
Submitted programs had to work within a time limit and produce
semantically identical output that was no larger than the input
document. 

<H1><A NAME="section-4.">The Story</A></H1>

<P>
I managed to communicate with Tyson and Peter by phone while working
from the office for the first day or so of the project, but after that
we lost connectivity (they turned the power off at work and I had to
continue at home over a 33Kbs dialup) and efforts diverged, so Tyson
and Peter ended up submitting a separate entry (this despite battling
'flu and hangovers respectively!) 

<P>
By the end of the first day I'd got the parser working, generating a
sensible representation, and some code to do space compression and
simplification. The parser is a hand coded affair and not terribly
pretty: the right thing to do would have been to knock up a shell
script in Awk to turn the source document into a form that could be
handled by the standard Mercury term parser, thereby saving much time,
typing and generation of boilerplate. 

<P>
As soon as space compression is complete the program writes out a
candidate solution file with only that optimization, to ensure that it
will have at least one solution that is no larger than the input at
the end of the time limit (there is a small chance that the main
optimizer will make things worse). The next step transforms the
tag-based version to a form that discards the source tag nesting
information. 

<P>
The internal representation the program uses separates out the
plaintext from the document, annotated with each successive region
sharing the same attribute vector. Moving away from any kind of tree
based representation seemed likely to make the various optimizations
easier to implement (thanks to Holger for pushing this one.) 

<PRE>
        Example
        Input:     &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;bla bla&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;TT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;foo bar&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; truc&lt;/TT&gt;

        Plaintext: bla blafoo bar truc          }
                   |      |      |              }     Internal
        Attrs:     A1     A2     A3             }
                   |      |      |              }  Representation
        Extents:   7      7      5              }

        Where A1 = {B, I}
        and   A2 = {B, I, TT}
        and   A3 = {TT}
</PRE>

<P>
The core of the optimizer takes a "window" of attribute regions and
searches for the optimal tagging for that region in the context of the
stack of open tags at the beginning of the window.  The search uses
iterative deepening over an exhaustive search to guarantee optimality.
A small extra cost is exacted by the search engine for opening tags
rather than closing them to discourage it from growing the open tag
stack too deep. This can be a problem because when a region interface
specifies returning to the root size and/or colour the only thing that
can be done is close tags until that goal has been met. 

<PRE>
        Example with window size 4:
        +-------------+-------------+-------
        | A1 A2 A3 A4 | A5 A6 A7 A8 | A9 ...
        +-------------+-------------+-------
            Window        Window        Window
</PRE>

<P>
The search engine was rather easy to write because Mercury is also a
logic programming language and hence quite at home with the idea of
non-determinism. In fact, apart from the tag-opening penalty, there
are no heuristics in this component of the search engine at all! 

<P>
The optimizer splits the document up into consecutive windows of
attribute vectors, each of which is tagged in turn. Since the search
mechanism makes no references to earlier windows other than the open
tag stack they leave, the solution for each window is written out as
it is identified. The final task is to close any remaining open tags. 

<P>
The optimizer is run repeatedly with window sizes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
This may turn out to have been a bad idea because the search space for
a 16 region window is probably too large for the program to finish
within the time limit. A better solution would have been to use window
sizes of 2, 4, 6, 8, ... up to some limit (the optimizer can generate
a lot of solutions for small files!) 

<P>
[Note that since the internal representation is a compressed form of
the semantics of the source document, no benefit could be obtained by
pipelining this optimizer after any other, although it may be possible
that having it as a first stage to a different kind of optimizer could
be useful.] 

<P>
The Mercury program is run from within a small Bash shell script that
then goes to sleep until just before the time limit, whereupon it
selects the smallest complete solution generated by the Mercury
program. Since the program runs until the time limit expires, there's
no chance it will beat anyone on time! 

<P>
I had the bulk of the optimizer finished after the pub on Saturday
night and spent Sunday morning fixing minor bugs and coding the
support harness. Pleasingly, the optimizer succeeds at finding all the
suggested improvements in section 4 of the task specification. It even
finds the optimal solution to the following posed by Mark Shields here
at Microsoft Research: 

<PRE>
        Example Input:
        &lt;r&gt;-1-&lt;/r&gt;&lt;g&gt;-2-&lt;/g&gt;&lt;b&gt;-3-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;r&gt;-1-&lt;/r&gt;&lt;b&gt;-3-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;g&gt;-2-&lt;/g&gt;
        |--red---||-green--||--blue--||--red---||--blue--||-green--|

        Optimized Output (window size 2):
        &lt;r&gt;-1-&lt;g&gt;-2-&lt;b&gt;-3-&lt;r&gt;-1-&lt;/r&gt;-3-&lt;/b&gt;-2-&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/r&gt;
                          |--red---|
                    |--------blue---------|
              |--------------green---------------|
        |--------------------red---------------------|

        Optimized Output (window size 8):
        &lt;r&gt;-1-&lt;/r&gt;&lt;g&gt;-2-&lt;b&gt;-3-&lt;r&gt;-1-&lt;/r&gt;-3-&lt;/b&gt;-2-&lt;/g&gt;
        |--red---|            |--red---|
                        |--------blue---------|
                  |--------------green---------------|
</PRE>

<P>
The optimality of the window size 2 output was a surprise: we didn't
see it and thought the window size 8 solution was the unique smallest
solution!

<H1><A NAME="section-5.">Statistics</A></H1>

<P>
The program consists of four modules comprising 

<UL>
  <LI>336 lines of code, 
  <LI>129 lines of type, mode and compiler declarations, 
  <LI>223 lines of comment, and 
  <LI>252 blank lines, giving 
<HR>
  <LI>940 lines in total. 

</UL>
<H1><A NAME="section-6.">Interesting Idea</A></H1>

<P>
An interesting twist on the search strategy would be to take a leaf
out of the games AI book: rather than treat each window separately,
treat each attribute region interface separately and work out the
optimal tagging looking one window's length ahead. This would slow
the search process down in proportion to the window size, but might
produce better results.
