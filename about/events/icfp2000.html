This page describes the

entry into the 
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/icfp/">ICFP 2000 programming

<H3>The Contest</H3>

The ICFP 2000 programming contest was to implement a ray tracer.
<p>
The input to the ray tracer was a scene description written in a simple
functional language, called GML.  Execution of a GML program produces
zero, or more, image files, which are in PPM format.  The feature set of
GML was organized into three tiers, all of which were implemented by the
Mercury entry.
<p>
GML has primitives for defining simple geometric objects (e.g., planes,
spheres, and cubes) and lighting sources. The surface properties of the
geometric objects used to render the objects are specified as functions
in GML itself.  GML also defined operators for combining the simple
geometric objects to create more complex objects.  In addition to
supporting scene description, GML also has a render operator that
renders a scene to an image file. For each pixel in the output image,
the render command must compute a colour.  Conceptually, this colour is
computed by tracing the path of the light backwards from the eye of the
viewer, to where it bounced off an object, and ultimately back to the
light sources.
<p>

The contest rules stated that a team had 72 hours to implement a ray
tracer.  The ray tracer could be implemented in any language, and the  
team could consist of any size.  The short time frame of the contest
meant that programming languages that help programmers to build complex
systems quickly should give an advantage.  (see the 
<a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/icfp/results.html">report</a>
on the 1999 programming contest for more information).

The Mercury entry was produced by a team of 13 members (at least 10 of
which contributed code to the ray tracer).  The team was also distributed
over three countries (Australia (11 members), England (1 member) and  
Belgium (1 member)).  Both the members of the team in England and
Belgium contributed significant amounts of code.  Nearly all the
communication between distrubuted team members took place via email (the
England and Belgium team members spoke occasionally by phone).
<p>
It should be remembered that Europe and Australia are
nearly 12 hours apart in time-zones, so for nearly the entire 72 hours
of the contest there was someone, somewhere in the world working on our
entry.  However, given the preferred working habits of some of the
Mercury team members, this might have happened regardless of geography.
<p>

<H3>The entry and results</H3>

Out of a field of 38 entries, we came 4th.  For the first ever entry in 
Mercury, this is a fine accomplishment.  We were also the largest team
entry (13 members), nearly double the next largest team (7 members).
<p>
The rankings were largely determined by correctness (only 4 teams
produced approximately the right results for all the images).  After
that we were ranked on speed, and that's where our entry didn't fare so
well.  The full contest results are available 
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/icfp/contest_results.htm">here</a>.
<p>
Unfortunately, we had to turn off one of our key optimizations (bounding
spheres) because we found it caused a few pixels of error in one of the
images when we submitted.   On the small sample images this gave us a
speedup of 50%, however on more complex images it may have been even
higher.
<p>
This was unlikely to have even moved us up a place, however, because the
Mercury implementation of floating point is fairly slow on the x86
processor.  At this point in the contest, our competition consisted of
compilers with very good floating point support.  This is a weakness in
the Mercury implementation that we'd love to fix.
<p>
Between these two efficiency problems, we quickly fell off the pace when
the contest images became large and complex.
<p>
One of the frustrating parts of the competition was that we encountered
quite a few bugs in the specification and the sample images.  Many hours
were spent trying to figure out why our correct ray tracer refused to
produce the wrong image.  This isn't meant to be a criticism of the
organizers -- they have a tough job, but keeping 13 people around the
world up to date with task descriptions, image updates, food and caffeine
was a tough job.
<p>
Of our own bugs, two of the most common were
incorrect signs, and using non-unit vectors when unit-vectors were
expected.  We recommend using the type system to prevent the unit vector
error if anyone wants to write a ray-tracer in Mercury in the future.

<H3>Using Mercury</H3>

The distributed nature of the entry and the lack of problems encountered
due to the distribution of team members is a feather in the cap of the  
Mercury language.  The strong type and mode system ensured that if an
interface between distinct parts of the ray tracer changed, the spots  
which were impacted by the change were reported by the Mercury compiler,
and could quickly be corrected.  It also meant that different team
members could work on different solutions to the same problem, as long
as both solutions agreed on a common interface, and the best one could
be chosen.  It's interesting to note that all four of the top entries
used languages with strong static checking, like the type and mode
system in Mercury.

The statistics for all the source files (including source files which  
were used to debug individual components of the ray tracer) are as

Mercury provides an interface to the C language.  This interface was
used once to do an efficient ray-box intersection test.  The C code for
this was located from the web, and rather then recoding the algorithm in
Mercury we used the C code verbatim.  
<p>

Functional programmers often ask whether any of Mercury's logic features
were useful in this contest (as many of the other features of Mercury
are very similar to functional languages).
We didn't end up using any non-deterministic search in our final entry.
However, we certainly used them during the early coding of the project.
Our original implementation of finding the nearest intersection point of
a ray simply found all the intersections using a call to `solutions' and
a nondeterministic search through all the available objects.  We
eventually removed this code as we started using different algorithms to
find the intersecting objects.

The actual ray tracer source is available from the Mercury CVS archive
in the module icfp2000.  The CVSROOT environment variable should be set
to :pserver:guest@hydra.cs.mu.oz.au:/home/mercury1/repository. The password
is `guest'.

</pre>

<p>
You will need a recent daily release of the Mercury system to compile
and build the code (The current 0.9.1 release lacks a few features that
we have used in the ray tracer).  You can download Mercury from the
snapshots section of the
<a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/">Mercury homepage</a>.
