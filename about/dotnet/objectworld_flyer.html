<h3>
The Mercury Language
</h3>

Mercury is a new logic programming language, designed and implemented by a
research group at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering
at the University of Melbourne.  Mercury programs look quite similar to
programs written in previous logic programming languages such as Prolog.
However, Mercury's objective is very different from Prolog's; whereas Prolog is
oriented towards exploratory programming in fields such as AI, Mercury is
intended for the production of large scale, reliable software systems by teams
of programmers.
<p>
Mercury programs closely resemble mathematically logic.
Programmers write programs as a set of relations augmented with declarations
that say how the programmer intends these relations to be used. 
<p>

<pre>
:- pred hello(string, postcode, string).
:- mode hello(in, in, out) is semidet.
hello(Name, PostCode, Greeting) :-
        suburb_codes(PostCode, Suburb),
        Greeting = "Hello " ++ Name ++ " of " ++ Suburb.

:- pred suburb_codes(postcode, string).
:- mode suburb_codes(in, out) is semidet.
suburb_codes(2000, "Sydney").
suburb_codes(3000, "Melbourne").
</pre>
<p>
A call to <tt>hello("Mary", 2000, X)</tt> will mean 
<tt>X = "Hello Mary of Sydney"</tt>.
<p>
Mercury is a very expressive, high-level programming language.  It automates
several common programming tasks such as giving the types of local variables,
allocating and deallocating memory, and caching previously computed results.
<p>
Mercury has a strong type system, and a mode system that does dataflow
checking.  These checks ensure that a large class of programming errors such as
missing cases in switches and uninitialized variables are guaranteed to be
caught by the compiler.  It is a common experience to hear from Mercury
programmers 
<em>"Once I got my program past the compiler, it worked first time!"</em>
The compiler also simplifies maintenance tasks such as adding a new field to a
structure by pointing out all the places where the code must be modified to
accommodate the new field.  Mercury's type system is very advanced, and
provides powerful programming abstractions such as parametric polymorphism
(similar to generics and templates), type-classes (similar to interfaces in
Java) and user-controlled dynamic typing while still retaining complete safety.
Type classes can be used to interoperate with component-based systems
such as COM and CORBA.
<p>
Mercury has been used in a wide variety of applications, which include
intelligent planning systems, a process flow web-server, formal specification
animation systems and neural net implementations. It is well suited to creating
complex, flexible, highly reliable applications.  Some of these applications
have already been deployed commercially.
<h3>
Declarative Programming
</h3>
Unlike imperative programming languages such as C++, Java or Basic, Mercury
doesn't have concepts such as global variables or pass-by-reference.  Instead,
if a procedure needs access to a variable, that variable must be one of its
parameters.  If it calculates a value that is needed elsewhere, it returns that
value (it doesn't overwrite a location or modify a global variable).  Explicit
parameters make any complexity immediately visible and encourage programmers to
eliminate (or at least manage) complexity rather than sweep it under the rug.
Programming without side effects (such as updating global variables) is called
<em>purely declarative programming</em>.
<p>
In declarative programming languages programmers clearly and cleanly specify
<em>what is to be computed</em>, and leaving the question of 
<em>how to compute it</em> to the compiler and runtime system.
Programmers are relieved of the burden of allocating memory, specifying
the order of operations (except where the order is visible in the
output), or defining data-structures down to the bit level.  The
intention is to allow the programmer to devote their time to <em>solving
problems</em>, rather than <em>programming machines</em>.
<p>
Since the burden of deciding how to implement the program has been shifted to
the compiler, declarative language compilers are pretty smart.  Declarative
languages are simple and state directly what the result of the program is
supposed to be; the compiler is free to re-arrange the program in any way it
desires so long as the result of the program remains the same.  Declarative
language compilers routinely automate optimisations that are usually considered
too difficult to implement in imperative language compilers, and too time
consuming and error prone to do by hand.  
<p>
The Mercury implementation can already optimise programs to remove intermediate
data structures, omit unnecessary sub-computations and redundant tests, turn
structure traversals into loops, perform cross-module inlining, eliminate
unused arguments or procedures and specialize code to operate on specific
types, and more optimisations are being added all the time. The upshot of all
this optimisation is that programmers can write more complex programs more
quickly, and still get competitive performance.
<p>
Another important benefit of the absence of side-effects is that one can
use <em>declarative debugging</em> to debug programs written in
declarative programming languages.  With traditional debuggers, all of
the grunt work of finding the bug has to be done by the programmer.
Declarative debugging automates much of this grunt work.  Declarative
debuggers ask the programmer a series of questions about the intended
behaviour of the program.  By comparing the intended behaviour of the
program with its actual behaviour, they can find the point in the
program where the results of several correct sub-computations are
combined into an incorrect result; in other words, they find a place where the
program starts to go wrong.  Having the debugger direct the search for the bug
is particularly useful for novice programmers, who often don't know where to
start.  However it often helps experienced programmers as well, by preventing
them from spending too much effort searching blind alleys.  Searching blind
alleys can be very time consuming as well as frustrating; avoiding such
searches should make debugging more enjoyable, productive and predictable.
<h3>
Mercury on .NET
</h3>
The main component of Microsoft's .NET framework is the Common Language Runtime
or CLR, a new multi-language execution platform.  Microsoft has C++, C#,
Visual Basic and JScript compilers that generate code for the CLR. Code
running on the CLR can be executed on standard PCs, inside web servers
or database engines, on PDAs, or wherever else the .NET framework runs.
Because all the languages running on the CLR use the same code and data
representation, it is significantly easier for different programming
languages to co-exist and communicate seamlessly than on other
platforms. 
<p>
The .NET CLR has been designed with languages such as C++, C# and Visual Basic
in mind. Therefore the language constructs that can appear in the interfaces
between .NET components are limited to those found in imperative languages and
their object-oriented extensions.  Fortunately Microsoft realized that
non-mainstream languages have strengths that some developers will want to
exploit.  Accordingly they decided to consult with the implementors of several
emerging languages, both in academia and industry, on the best ways to extend
the CLR to avoid such problems.  Since such problems can only be found by
experience with real implementations, Microsoft funded several research groups
(including ours) to modify their language implementations to target the CLR and
provide feedback and suggestions.  For example, some features in Mercury are
not represented directly in the CLR, and so cannot be exposed to other
components (although they can of course continue to be used inside Mercury
components).  These kinds of mismatches provide suggestions for extensions of
both Mercury and the CLR.  Some of these suggestions have already been acted
upon, and will be included in the first public release of the CLR, while others
will be incorporated in future releases.  Support for parametric polymorphism
is likely to fall into the second category; it is already being prototyped by
Microsoft Research.
<p>
We have completed a prototype backend in the Mercury implementation that
generates code for the CLR.  This code can interoperate 
<!--- seamlessly XXX but we aren't quite seamless yet. -->
with code generated by any other compiler on the .NET platform.  If
developers want to enjoy the benefits of Mercury, they can start small
by writing a few .NET components in Mercury while the rest of the
project is implemented in more traditional languages.  The .NET
component model allows a company to evaluate and roll out advanced
programming languages without introducing critical project risks. 
<p>
To demonstrate the possibilities of interoperation in this environment,
we extended the Mercury implementation of <tt>eliza</tt>, a classic AI
program that pretends to be a psychotherapist.  Using the CLR COM
interface, we used a standard COM object (Microsoft Agent) to give
<tt>eliza</tt> a voice and an animated character.  We used the WinForms
class library in .NET and some C# code to give <tt>eliza</tt> a very
simple graphical front end, where users could enter text and view
eliza's previous responses.  This shows the strength of multi-language
development: unlike C#, Mercury has features that make writing an AI
engine easier, whereas existing GUI builders generate C# code, not
Mercury code.  The .NET platform allows programmers to use the right
tool for the right job.

<h3>Further Information</h3>

The Mercury implementation is open source software.  The system includes a
compiler (written in Mercury, of course!), debugger, profiler, libraries
and documentation, and is available on Windows, Linux and on major Unix
platforms.
