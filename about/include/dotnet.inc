<h2> Mercury on .NET </h2>

<h3> Summary </h3>
<p>
The Mercury compiler has a back-end that targets
the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/">Microsoft .NET platform</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Microsoft's generous support, both financial
and otherwise, we've been able to port Mercury to Microsoft's
.NET system.  There's a back-end for the Mercury compiler,
based on the `--high-level-code' back-end, that compiles to IL, the
Microsoft .NET Intermediate Language.
</p>
<p>
This back-end is enabled using the new `il' grade.
</p>
<p>
This is still work in progress.
</p>

<h3> Status </h3>

<p>2009-09-25: Currently this back-end does not work and is not being
developed. </p>
<p>

The <a href="<?php echo $root ?>/download/rotd.html">release-of-the-day releases</a>
of the Mercury compiler include support for generating code for .NET.
They also include a port of most of the Mercury standard library and runtime
to .NET.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="<?php echo $root ?>/download/release.html">current release</a>
also includes some support for the .NET backend, but coverage
of the Mercury standard library for .NET is much improved in the
release-of-the-day releases, so if you want to use the .NET back-end,
we recommend that you use a release-of-the-day release rather than the
official current release.
</p>
<p>
<h4> The bad news </h4>
<p>
At this point it is still a beta-quality release; it's hard to install,
there are still some parts of the standard library which are not yet
implemented for this port, it's not well tested, not yet efficient,
and may be subject to change in future releases.
</p>
<h4> The good news </h4>
<p>
The good news is that the new back-end does support all the standard
Mercury language features:
</p>
<ul class="nonindentlist">
<li> parametric polymorphism
<li> multi-parameter type classes
<li> higher-order procedures and closures
<li> existential types
<li> multi-moded procedures
<li> backtracking
<li> etc.
</ul>
<p>
And if you're interested in checking it out, it's available for
<a href="<?php echo $root ?>/download.html">download</a> today.
