<h2>Mercury Reports</h2>

<i>Looking for technical reports?</i>  See the 
<a href="papers.html">papers</a> of the web site.

<p>

Please note that Mercury meetings are not always regularly scheduled --
the absence of a meeting probably indicates people travelling, busy
writing papers or implementing the system.  It's also possible that we
just didn't write any minutes for the meeting. 
The <a href="<?php echo $root ?>/mailing-lists/mailing-lists.html"> mailing
list archives</a> are the best place to go to check the activity of the
developers.
