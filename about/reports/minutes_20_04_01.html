We had a meeting of the Mercury group on Fri April 20, 2001,
from 3.15pm to 4.35pm.

Attendees:
	Zoltan Somogyi (zs)
	Fergus Henderson (trd)
	Simon Taylor (stayl)
	David Overton (dmo)
	Kevin Glynn (keving)

Progress reports

	We went around the table, with each person in turn discussing what
	they had been working on recently and/or what they were planning
	to work on.

	Zoltan Somogyi (zs)
		- Working on cleaning up deep profiling.
		  It now bootstraps and passes all the test cases except for
		  - split_c_files
		  - the debugger tests that use `retry'
		  - exception handling tests that catch exceptions
		    (just throwing without catching works, though)
		  There are also some issues with the UI and documentation
		  that need to be resolved.
		  Plans to merge the the deep profiling branch changes back
		  onto the main branch soon.

		- Mentioned a `cvdd' script for doing diffs on two Mercury
		  repository; fjh suggested that it might be a good idea
		  to put that in the `tools' directory in our repository
		
	Simon Taylor (stayl)
		- Has continued working on a system to keep track of compilation
		  dependencies in a fairly fine-grained way.
		- Agreed to put support for `--make' option (see below)
		  on his long-term TODO list.

	David Overton (dmo)
		- Has implemented, in Mercury, the extensions to ROBDDs that
		  Peter Schache describes in his thesis.
		  (This is built on top of Peter's C implementation of basic
		  ROBDDs and a thin Mercury interface to this which dmo
		  wrote about a year ago.)
		- Continued working on the new mode checker.
		  New mode checker is still looping on `deriv' test case
		- We suggested that it would be good for dmo to commit his
		  stuff on a branch, and probably also to put the extended
		  ROBDDs package in the extras distribution on the main branch.
		  The issue of needing this in both the compiler and
		  the extras should be handled the same way as for dl.m,
		  putting it in the `compiler' directory in the CVS repository
		  and copying it to the extras directory when we build the
		  extras distribution.

	Fergus Henderson (fjh)
		- Has been helping people to port Mercury to Mac OS X (Darwin).
		  zs suggested asking about the possibility of getting a
		  guest account.

		- Has been working on solving abstract equivalence types
		  problem for .NET/Java back-ends.

		  zs said he didn't like tying this to
		  `--intermodule-optimization'.
		  After some discussion, fjh agreed.  zs suggested instead
		  keeping a database of all equivalence types.
		  fjh said this is similar to the approach of using `.typ'
		  files; will look more at that approach.
		  `--intermodule-optimization' will be used as an interim
		  solution.

		- Has been working on porting Mercury to Mingw.
		  We discussed some of the issues here.

		  dmo asked why dependency on Cygwin is a problem;
		  answers were cultural issues, use of Unix pathnames,
		  and extra download.  fjh will investigate the possibility
		  of a minimal solution which fixes the pathname issues
		  without bothering to eliminate all the dependencies on
		  Cygwin.

		  Dependencies on Cygwin are:
		  - scripts: mmc, c2init, ml
		  - mmake
		  	Some of this functionality could migrate into the
			the Mercury compiler:
				- basic functionality would be to have
				  an option (`--build'?) to do all the
				  steps of compilation (mmc --make-short-int,
				  mmc --make-int, mmc --compile, link)
				- next level is having an option (`--make')
				  to only build things if they are out-of-date
				- last level is the stuff you can do using
				  non-trivial Mmakefiles: having different
				  sets of options for different modules,
				  extra targets, etc.; we probably *don't* want
				  to put that kind of functionality in the
				  compiler
		  - use of shell commands in the compiler, e.g. `mkdir'
		    Possible alternative would be to do that directly,
		    using system calls, rather than using shell commands.

General discussion

	- zs brought up the point that the Posix library (and others in
	  the extras distribution) lack visibility; could we put in the
	  main compiler distribution?
	  Perhaps there should be a second class of standard libraries
	  for non-portable libraries which are nevertheless always installed
	  on systems which support them.
	  fjh said that portability is not the only problem; the current Posix
	  library is also not complete enough or well-documented enough to meet
	  our quality standards for the standard library.

	- we discussed changing (reducing) the set of grades installed by
	  default.  zs suggested the possibility of an interactive choice.
	  fjh said that `configure' can't be interactive, since that would
	  violate GNU standards, but we could have an interactive "install"
	  script that asked the user which grades they wanted (minimal,
	  complete, or custom; then if custom, do you want debugging,
	  profiling, trailing, etc.) and then invoked "configure", "make",
	  and "make install".

	- We discussed making `--use-subdirs' enabled by default.
	  Not a big issue on Linux, because of sufficiently efficient
	  file system access even with large numbers of files in a single
	  directory, but may be useful on other systems.
	  This would make it trivial to migrate `mmake clean'
	  functionality into the compiler.
	  It might also be particularly useful if we also change mmake
	  to support building multiple grades in a single directory
	  simultaneously.
