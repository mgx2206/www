1. Progress reports

	We went around the table, with each person in turn discussing what
	they had been working on recently and/or what they were planning
	to work on.

	Fergus Henderson (fjh)
		- Has been doing code reviews.
		- Has been fixing several bugs.
		- Working on abstract equivalence types for the .NET and
		  Java back-ends.
		- Working on getting the gcc back end installed on hg.

	Simon Taylor (stayl)
		- Starting work on the new build framework supporting
		  intermodule optimization.

	Mark Brown (dougl)
		- Has been doing code reviews.

	David Overton (dmo)
		- Working on an extension to ROBDD's described in a paper
		  by Peter Schachte.
		- Setting up a web server on venus.

	Adrian Pellas-Rice (apell)
		- Has completed a working subset of sequence quantification.
		- Is currently working on expanding on that.

	Ina Cheng (inch)
		- Writing samples and documentation.
		- Server/client interface is finished.

	Simon Mei (xcsm)
		- Addressing review comments.
		- Sent a bug report for get_functor.

	Sam Thurairatnam (sthur)
		- Has been working on saving formatting data to a file
		  and loading it in to the debugger.

	Julien Fischer (juliensf)
		- Addressing review comments.
		- Working on runtime system for the Java backend.

	David Jeffery (dgj)
		- Working on merging changes from the HAL branch to the
		  main branch.
		- There are still some issues to fix before this will be
		  committed.

	Zoltan Somogyi (zs)
		- Has been working with Thomas Conway on the deep profiler.
			- Optimization to preserve tail recursion in common
			  cases.
			- Improved reporting where different code is called
			  from the same location (e.g. higher order calls).
		- Has fixed a bug which was causing the erroneous_liveness
		  test case to fail.

2. New machine

	David Overton has been setting up venus to act as the web server,
	but we also need some other services set up.  Fergus Henderson has
	volunteered to set up FTP, and Mark Brown has volunteered to set up
	CVS.  We will be asking Peter Ross if he would set up NIS.

3. Release

	- Most bugs have been fixed by now.
	- There has been a recent problem with groups and permissions in
	  the CVS repository.  Anyone making any changes to the repository
	  should check the permissions afterward and note any strange
	  behaviour, so we can narrow down what is causing this problem.

4. Configure script

	The configure script will check for a more recent compiler,
	following Simon Taylor's suggestion.
