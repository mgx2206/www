	Mark Brown (dougl)
	Peter Stuckey (pjs)

Progress reports

	We went around the table, with each person in turn discussing
	what they had been working on recently and/or what they were
	planning to work on.

	Fergus Henderson (fjh):
		- Talked about what he had been doing in Redmond,
		  including learning about: Visual Studio integration,
		  Windows installation programs (e.g. InstallShield),
		  and CodeDom.  He also attended a meeting of the ECMA
		  standards committee for the CLS.
		- Will be reviewing submissions to Babel for the next
		  few weeks.

	Zoltan Somogyi (zs):
		Has been working on:
		- display of arrays in the debuger and changes to the
		  type-related utilitities in std_util.
		- cosmetic changes and bug fixes for the deep
		  profiler.  We had a discussion about what features
		  people would find useful in the deep profiler user
		  interface.

	Simon Taylor (stayl):
		Has been working on:
		- smart recompilation
		- moving mmake functionality into the compiler
		- higher-order optimisations, focussing on Tom's
		  parser combinators.

	David Overton (dmo):
		- Has been marking exams (i.e. no work on Mercury this
		  week).

	Mark Brown (dougl):
		- Has been working on an IL to IL transformation for
		  "retry".
		- Has been studying the .net debug API.

	Peter Stuckey (pjs):
		- Has been reading about region-based memory
		  management.  We had a discussion about the pros and
		  cons of adding this to Mercury.  Summary: it would
		  be too hard to add alongside the Boehm GC, but could
		  work well alongside an accurate GC for some kinds of
		  programs.  However, since the accurate GC is still
		  not finished, any development effort that becomes
		  available should go towards that first.
