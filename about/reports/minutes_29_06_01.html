	Mark Brown (dougl)
	Simon Taylor (stayl)
	David Overton (dmo)

1. Progress reports

	We went around the table, with each person in turn discussing what
	they had been working on recently and/or what they were planning
	to work on.

	Tyson Dowd (trd):
		- Back from Microsoft.
		- The .NET backend now works with .NET Beta 2.
		- Adding support for IL foreign code.
		- Discussed possible improvements to the foreign code
		  implementation. One suggestion was that the language
		  should allow a default Mercury implementation of a
		  predicate to be overridden by a more efficient foreign
		  code implementation depending on the grade and target
		  language.
		- Thesis writing.

	Zoltan Somogyi (zs):
		- Improvements for deep profiling, in particular improving
		  the way profile data is presented to the user.

	Fergus Henderson (fjh):
		- BABEL conference reviewing.
		- Fixed unnecessary casting in the high level C backend.
		- Thought about how Mercury can use Microsoft's codeDOM API.

	Mark Brown (dougl):
		- Working on an IL->IL transformation to allow
		  retry in the .NET debugger.
		- Improved the pretty printer.
		- Fixed a bug in last year's ICFP contest submission.

	Simon Taylor (stayl):
		- Committed smart recompilation.
		- Implementing the `--make' compiler option discussed in
		  earlier meetings.

	David Overton (dmo):
		- Exam marking.

	David Jeffery (dgj):
		- Thesis writing.
