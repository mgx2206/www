1. Progress reports.

		grades to install.

	David Overton <dmo>:

		- Has returned to working on the alias tracking mode checker.

	Julien Fischer <juliensf>:

		- Working on the Java backend, which is now almost
		to the point where hello_world.m runs.

		- Working on implementing parts of library/io.m in Java.

	Simon Mei <xcsm>:

		- More work on the ``quickcheck''-style test generator.

		- Wrote some code which generates test cases for
		predicates which take up to 5 arguments of type
		int, char or list(char).

	Ina Cheng <inch>:

		Peter Schachte <schachte> and Adrian Pellas-Rice <apell>.
